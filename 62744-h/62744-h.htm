that embodied in its declaration of absolute
freedom of expression, which makes for a range
broad enough to include every temperament from
the most radical to the most conservative, the only
requisite being that the work should have unmistakable
merit. Each issue will be devoted exclusively
to one individual, thereby giving him an opportunity
to present his work in sufficient bulk to
make it possible for the reader to obtain a much
more comprehensive grasp of his personality than is
afforded him in the restricted space allotted by the
other magazines. Published monthly, or more frequently
if possible, THE GLEBE will issue twelve
to twenty books per year, chosen on their merits
alone, since the subscription list does away with the
need of catering to the popular demand that confronts
every publisher. Thus, THE GLEBE can
promise the best work of American and foreign
authors, known and unknown.
</p>

<p>
The price of each issue of THE GLEBE will vary
with the cost of publication, but the yearly subscription,
including special numbers, is three dollars.

THE AZURE ADDER
</p>

</div>

<p>
<span class="hdr">Scene.</span> <span class="sd">Studio of Vivian. Simplicity run riot
is the keynote: white against white; white walls
and little furniture. The furniture is painted gray,
Vivian&rsquo;s gray&mdash;really white.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="hdr">Time.</span> <span class="sd">The ultra-present.</span>
</p>

<p>
(<span class="sd">The curtain rises. For a minute or two the
stage is empty. Then enter Vivian, through the
door at the back of the stage, the only door in the
scene. He wears the dress of the ancient Greeks
and is evidently just coming from the bath, as
shown by his damp hair. In one hand he carries
a few narcissi, while with the other he tries to
arrange the folds of drapery, which seem to hinder
his movements. He arranges one or two flowers
in a jar, before the &ldquo;Nike de Samothrace,&rdquo; whispering:</span>
&ldquo;Yes, narcissi, truly like Grecian things.&rdquo;
<span class="sd">He drops the rest of the flowers upon the floor,
removes the robe and starts to comb his hair before
a small mirror. This mirror is set in the back of
a large framed photograph of the &ldquo;Venus de Milo&rdquo;
<a id="page-6" class="pagenum" title="6"></a>
that hangs near the door. Vivian turns the Venus
photograph to the wall and we see the small piece
of looking-glass. He finally rouges his lips as a
finishing touch to his toilet. Putting on a coat but
retaining the sandals, he moves towards the door;
on the way he picks up a hat, which he puts on
carefully. As he nears the door a knock is heard
and the door is opened. Vivian takes on the look
of being in the higher heights of thought. Two
girls are discovered in the door-way. One, Yvonne,
says:</span> &ldquo;Bon jour.&rdquo; <span class="sd">The second, Alice:</span> &ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;
<span class="sd">Both enter. Vivian passes them in the door-way
without speaking and softly closes the door.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Vivian</span> (<span class="sd">outside</span>). I&rsquo;m going out. (<span class="sd">And
more softly.</span>) Wait, wait.
</p>

<p>
(<span class="sd">The girls remove their hats. Yvonne sinks on
the floor, in front of the couch.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Yvonne.</span> Oh, I&rsquo;m so tired. I painted for two
hours yesterday.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice</span> (<span class="sd">sitting on the couch</span>). How you work&mdash;and
you would have painted again to-day, if I
hadn&rsquo;t stopped for you, no doubt.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Yvonne.</span> Well, I was thinking about it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Ridiculous! Do you think that Beauty
can be contemplated constantly? One either becomes
<a id="page-7" class="pagenum" title="7"></a>
blind or mad&mdash;you painted for two hours
yesterday&mdash;ridiculous!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Yvonne.</span> I&rsquo;ve seen nothing of yours of late.
Don&rsquo;t you work; don&rsquo;t you paint, I mean?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> I&rsquo;m waiting, waiting. For days,
months really, I have felt as though&mdash;how shall I
put it&mdash;as though the scales were about to fall
from my eyes; at moments like these, as you know,
when I really see the thing, I paint. Between times,
I wait, I wait.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Yvonne.</span> Couldn&rsquo;t you work and wait, too?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> No, I must save all my energy for
these supreme moments, when I see Beauty in its
essence.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Yvonne.</span> Then you really work less than I
thought.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice</span> (<span class="sd">in an awed voice</span>). Yvonne, how can
you! I work constantly. The air is my canvas,
my nerves are the brushes. I work? God, how I
do work! To contemplate, to wait, to dream, is
not this work?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Yvonne.</span> I suppose so&mdash;but&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Oh, I know&mdash;you all think, except
George, that I do nothing. Well, rather that, if it
were true, than what one generally sees on canvas,
every year, at the Academies.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-8" class="pagenum" title="8"></a>
<span class="speaker">Yvonne.</span> You think then that it is better not
to paint at all and wait as you say&mdash;than to do an
inferior thing?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Undoubtedly.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Yvonne.</span> This waiting&mdash;what effect will it
have&mdash;what will it do for you or for Art?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> I wait. &ldquo;To feel is better than to
know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Yvonne.</span> If one really feels, perhaps, but to
wait and wait and wait, you know what the end
will be?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> I hope to become like Beauty, myself&mdash;a
living creation, a work of art&mdash;even though I
do nothing ever in paint.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Yvonne.</span> Yes, that is the end&mdash;not really,
however, because to change Life directly to Art
means&mdash;(<span class="sd">The sentence is not finished, a knock
being heard at the door.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Here&rsquo;s Maud; she said that she would
meet me here and bring George. (<span class="sd">She goes and
opens the door. Enter George with Maud, sister
of Alice.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> Hello. I&rsquo;ve just received a wire from
Uncle Billy; he&rsquo;s coming to talk over the magazine
with us.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Will he back it?
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-9" class="pagenum" title="9"></a>
<span class="speaker">George</span> (<span class="sd">looking at Maud</span>). He will if I can
be with him and talk to him for a day or two, I
think. (<span class="sd">They exchange meaning glances.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Yvonne.</span> A magazine&mdash;you&rsquo;re starting one?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Yes, I forgot to tell you about it.
Something like the &ldquo;Yellow Book.&rdquo; It will be
covered in gray, though, printed on hand-made
paper with especially designed type&mdash;four numbers
a year. Have you thought of a name, as yet, for
our child, the magazine, George?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> Yes, it will be called the &ldquo;Azure
Adder.&rdquo; Gray and blue will be the colors of the
cover. Blue the color of the Soul and gray the
coloring of the Eternal Background!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud.</span> Wonderful&mdash;wonderful!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> It will be, I hope. (<span class="sd">He then addresses
the three girls, who are now sitting on the
couch.</span>) Intense, too, I want it to be. The first
look at its covers must create a mood for what one
is to find indoors. The same as a perfect house
affects one; the stones and vines of which, on the
outside, tell of the truffles which are to be served by
the mad butler at dinner, inside. (<span class="sd">To himself:</span> I
must remember that last; it&rsquo;s away above their
heads, of course&mdash;it&rsquo;s one of my best.) Blue and
gray&mdash;the two unfinished colors, when arranged
<a id="page-10" class="pagenum" title="10"></a>
as my design, will call up the proper mood: a mood
intense but languid, caring nothing for results. I
hope to make this, this caring nothing for results,
the aim of our child, the &ldquo;Azure Adder.&rdquo; To teach
the public, our public even, to be satisfied with the
unfinished, the artistically unfinished; the thing
which has no definite start or finish, but which is
beautiful, beautiful, beautiful even in the shadow
of its bud; a bud which can never open because&mdash;because&mdash;a
worm is its heart! (<span class="sd">Yvonne changes
her position on the couch.</span>) The size, too, of the
book will help in creating the mood&mdash;seven by
thirteen&mdash;and the paper on which it is printed, also,
will help. A paper made in Japan, under water,
which lasts only three years. It then falls apart,
insuring our child only a future, no past, nor any
permanency, except perhaps in the minds of its
readers, perhaps, perhaps. The &ldquo;Azure Adder&rdquo;
will have double pages like the books of the Japanese,
printed on one side, so that the mere reading
of it will be made difficult for the uninitiated&mdash;people
whom it is not meant for anyway. The
first number must strike the note&mdash;the ultra-future
note&mdash;so I will give to our public my dance-poem,
&ldquo;The Candle and the Black Water Lily.&rdquo; A poem,
have I told you, which I hope to have danced sometime.
It must be danced by one person while a
<a id="page-11" class="pagenum" title="11"></a>
chorus of men and boys chant the words, in place
of music for the dancer. How it will appeal, simply
alone, in the book, I don&rsquo;t know, without its
proper atmosphere. It almost required a new language,
I felt, when I wrote it. Still, it must be the
first of our first number&mdash;ultra-modern and a new
art&mdash;think, a new art! And the illustrations, what
a chance you will be, &ldquo;Azure Adder,&rdquo; for the artist
illustrator! A sweep of a brush, a tone, a dot is
enough for our purpose; when Beauty is sitting by
the side of the reader. Yes, I see a revolution in
book illustration, a glorious one, an upheaval, one
never-to-be-forgotten revolution, which, looked back
upon from the far distant future, will have at its
base, forgotten or remembered, who cares, the
&ldquo;Azure Adder&rdquo;!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud</span> and <span class="speaker">Alice</span>. Ah!
</p>

<p>
(<span class="sd">Yvonne rises, walks towards the large window
at the back, a sky-light really, opens it and
leans out during the following.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> If we can only get it started&mdash;we know
very little about such work.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud.</span> That makes no difference. We all
paint and all great art is one in its complete state.
We can surely run a magazine. If only Uncle,
George&rsquo;s Uncle Billy, will start it financially!
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-12" class="pagenum" title="12"></a>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> Oh, he will, I&rsquo;m sure. (<span class="sd">Smiles.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Whose stuff will we print in it besides
our own? If we could only get something from
some of the great living ones! But we can&rsquo;t hope
for more than one or two things from them, at
most, perhaps nothing, unless we prove a great
success.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> You doubt our success? You lack
egotism, my dear. I have already a poem, by one
of our greatest living English poets. It&rsquo;s written
in Italian.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud.</span> Of course it&rsquo;s beautiful.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> Of course, everything of his is.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Strange that he should send you a
poem written in Italian. It&rsquo;s beautiful, you say&mdash;I
didn&rsquo;t know that you read Italian?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> I don&rsquo;t&mdash;Palidino read it to me. I
asked him what it meant, what it was about. He
said that he did not understand its meaning&mdash;but
the sound of it, as he was reading it, was magnificent.
It is a masterpiece! Its meaning is clear to
me&mdash;Palidino understands nothing which is really
fine. The poem tells by its sound that the poet
writes of love, the love which is perfected by
death.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud</span> (<span class="sd">to herself</span>). &ldquo;The Triumph of Death.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-13" class="pagenum" title="13"></a>
<span class="speaker">Alice</span> (<span class="sd">softly</span>). George, you are wonderful; it
is fine to feel as finely as you do&mdash;I mean it, really
I do, George.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> You are beautiful. (<span class="sd">Pause.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud.</span> Still, it seems that we ought to have
more people to write for us. I can think of only
a few, one or two, who do good stuff, really fine
things&mdash;impressions.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> Oh, that will be all right. We have
enough material for our first number. The demand
will create the material. We will get plenty
of stuff sent in from unknowns, I think, for our
future numbers.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud.</span> If not, we can all write things for it.
I know that we all do write on the quiet while posing
as painters! Don&rsquo;t you write, Yvonne?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Yvonne</span> (<span class="sd">from window</span>). No, I only paint.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud</span> (<span class="sd">with a sneer</span>). But&mdash;oh, well&mdash;you do
read Kipling and Whitman; that&rsquo;s the reason you
don&rsquo;t write, I suppose.
</p>

<p>
(<span class="sd">No answer from Yvonne.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice</span> (<span class="sd">angrily</span>). Maud!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud.</span> Yes, that is what I mean. Art is not
the glorification of the beef-steak! &ldquo;Good red
blood&rdquo; is what you hear their admirers talking
<a id="page-14" class="pagenum" title="14"></a>
about principally. &ldquo;Healthy&rdquo; is another one of their
pet words, also &ldquo;men and women.&rdquo; They are all
meat&mdash;they forget the swaying sea-weed, the waxen
asphodel, the rose which is sick.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> Yes, you are right. If they had their
way, nothing would remain but the normal. And
as normal beings act usually in a commonplace and
unchanging manner, birth, love, death, literature,
would finally lose all material for existence and
both schools would either cease or write literature
about literature. A fine end this would be for their
good, red blood. No fear, though; there are always
plenty on the other side, like us, to make the scales
balance, perhaps even tip our way. Meat, the
glorified beef-steak, as you call it, Maud, has had
its day. It has made a good fight throughout the
centuries, but it is going, going&mdash;and to us&mdash;whom
it called abnormal, sick, degenerate, will soon remain
the field&mdash;yes, through what it called our
weakness we shall conquer!
</p>

<p>
(<span class="sd">Maud leans forward. Alice looks hurt. Maud
is about to speak when a knock is heard at the door.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud.</span> I&rsquo;ll go. (<span class="sd">Goes and opens the door.</span>)
Camele! (<span class="sd">She embraces and kisses Camele in the
door-way.</span>) Camele!
</p>

<p>
(<span class="sd">They come down to Alice and George. Camele
<a id="page-15" class="pagenum" title="15"></a>
is carrying canvases, painting materials, a kimona
and a suit case.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice</span> and <span class="speaker">George</span>. Hello!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> Let me take some of your things.
(<span class="sd">Takes her suit case.</span>) Lord, how heavy!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele</span> (<span class="sd">sinking upon the couch</span>). Heavy&mdash;I
have everything in it that I own. I couldn&rsquo;t stand
it any longer&mdash;last night it reached a climax&mdash;it&rsquo;s
all over, my married life&mdash;all over, girls! I&rsquo;ve left
Jack! Last night he struck me! (<span class="sd">Sobs.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud</span> (<span class="sd">to George</span>). The glorified beef-steak
variety&mdash;how common!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> Common, perhaps. (<span class="sd">To himself:</span>
One can strike a woman for lots of reasons.)
</p>

<p>
(<span class="sd">Yvonne comes from the window.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Poor Camele&mdash;lie down. Let me take
off your hat.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Yvonne.</span> What can we give her? Let us
make some tea.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud.</span> Yes, do. You and Alice make tea.
I&rsquo;ll sit with her a while.
</p>

<p>
(<span class="sd">George, Alice and Yvonne busy themselves
making tea at the extreme right, leaving Camele
and Maud at the extreme left, on the couch. No
one speaks for a moment.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-16" class="pagenum" title="16"></a>
<span class="speaker">Maud</span> (<span class="sd">sitting at Camele&rsquo;s head strokes her
hair</span>). Poor girl.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele.</span> Maud?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud.</span> Yes, dear.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele.</span> You were right; Jack is a brute.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud.</span> All men are.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele.</span> So you have often said, but I thought
that he was different.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud.</span> Brutes, beasts.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele.</span> But we were so happy at first&mdash;the
first months&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud.</span> Really happy?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele.</span> Yes, I was happy. I painted and
Jack was with me between times&mdash;yes, I was happy
and calm.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud.</span> You only thought so; I knew that it
couldn&rsquo;t last. I know you too well.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele.</span> Yes, you were right, I suppose.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud.</span> And what now?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele.</span> I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I broke with the family
when I married him, as you know&mdash;now, I don&rsquo;t
know.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George</span> (<span class="sd">from the tea table, to Alice and
Yvonne</span>). I&rsquo;ll go for some lemons. (<span class="sd">He goes
out.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-17" class="pagenum" title="17"></a>
<span class="speaker">Maud.</span> What a mistake to have married, Camele!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele.</span> No, it was not a mistake. I&rsquo;m not
sorry even now. (<span class="sd">Sits up.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud.</span> Camele, Camele!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele.</span> Well, it&rsquo;s the truth, I&rsquo;m not.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud.</span> But what will you do&mdash;where will you
live?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele.</span> I don&rsquo;t know yet.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud</span> (<span class="sd">after a pause, in a pleading voice</span>).
Come with us for a while.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele.</span> Maud, all right&mdash;to-night&mdash;just to-night
until I have time to think.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud.</span> As long as you like&mdash;Alice is used to
me protecting widows and children. (<span class="sd">She puts her
arm around Camele.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele.</span> Just for a day or two; I&rsquo;ll hunt for
a position to-morrow.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud.</span> You had much better write to your
family. They&rsquo;ll forgive you when they know that
you have left the brute. To think of him striking
you! Where did he strike you?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele.</span> Strike me? What do you mean&mdash;where
did he strike me?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud.</span> Why, you said when you came in that
Jack had struck you last night.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-18" class="pagenum" title="18"></a>
<span class="speaker">Camele.</span> How common of you, Maud&mdash;I
thought that you would understand. I didn&rsquo;t know
that any of you took things literally&mdash;you didn&rsquo;t
used to, when I knew you before my marriage, and
I knew you all very well.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud.</span> Very well, indeed&mdash;so he didn&rsquo;t strike
you?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele.</span> Yes, he did.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud.</span> Eh?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele.</span> Yes and no. You see, Jack had
been away for a week. I had been painting rather
hard and was very interested in an arrangement of
blacks I was trying to get. Subtle&mdash;blacks against
blacks. It was coming along well; I liked it in
parts very much. It was finished almost, yesterday,
before he came home. Then, last night, he
returned. I was tired, but decided to show him the
canvas, as he asked what I had been doing. We
went up to the studio. &ldquo;Stand there,&rdquo; I said, and
turned the canvas toward the light. It really looked
good: the tone was the best that I had ever had
in any of my canvases. He looked at it, and I at
him. He seemed to understand, at last, my work,
I thought. He had never done so before, which I
realized only after we were married, and which
came to worry me more and more. &ldquo;You do like
<a id="page-19" class="pagenum" title="19"></a>
it?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;it looks like a Sargent!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George</span> (<span class="sd">returns</span>). Here are the lemons.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud.</span> You did right&mdash;come with us! To
live with him now would be impossible. Strike
you&mdash;he did more&mdash;he tried to kill you&mdash;your soul.
He wanted you to go&mdash;he knew what he was saying
and how it would affect you. How you must
have suffered before the final crash of last night
came!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele.</span> Yes, and no, again. I don&rsquo;t believe
that I hate him half as much now as I did last
evening.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud.</span> Camele, he has spoiled you completely.
To hear you say that, after what has happened
between you, horrifies me.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele.</span> You were never married.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud.</span> Meat! Meat!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Yvonne.</span> Come, have some tea. Come, Camele.
</p>

<p>
(<span class="sd">Maude and Camele, arm in arm, move towards
the tea table, while George, followed by Alice, comes
and sits on the couch. The others sit around the
table.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> Why do you insist on following me?
<a id="page-20" class="pagenum" title="20"></a>
Stay with the girls over there&mdash;hear the joys of
married life.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Joys&mdash;I am more interested in knowing
why you did not come to see me, as you promised
last night?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> I didn&rsquo;t promise&mdash;I said &ldquo;probably.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> That&rsquo;s your word&mdash;but you usually
come. Why not last night? You knew that I
wanted to see you very much.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> I had something to do. I couldn&rsquo;t get
away.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Then why not have telephoned to me?
Maud had opera tickets given her&mdash;I missed &ldquo;Tristan,&rdquo;
waiting for you.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> At last we have the real cause of
your bad humor, which is not on account of my
non-appearance but your missing &ldquo;Tristan und
Isolde.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> You know, George, that that isn&rsquo;t
true.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> You started this argument&mdash;why cry
if you are hurt?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Cry?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> It&rsquo;s the same as crying&mdash;and tears,
you know how I hate them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-21" class="pagenum" title="21"></a>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Unless they be sprinkled on withered
rose leaves, yes!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> It&rsquo;s always the same thing; you constantly
insult my taste and brain.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> No, not your real taste and brain&mdash;they
are fine and great. I only insult the veneer.
I try to show you yourself,&mdash;this part I will save
for you and sometime return to its owner intact.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> Save?&mdash;how can you save something
which you have never had?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> That is my affair.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud</span> (<span class="sd">from the tea table, her voice raised in an
exciting discussion</span>). Bernard Shaw&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George</span> (<span class="sd">to himself</span>). Bernard Shaw? (<span class="sd">To
Alice.</span>) Well, save yourself the trouble, I will never
accept that from anyone&mdash;my real self. (<span class="sd">Nervously.</span>)
Alice, don&rsquo;t bother about me&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want
you to, do you understand?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice</span> (<span class="sd">laughs</span>). You dare to command me?
Well, let us both play the same game. Tell me&mdash;why
didn&rsquo;t you come to see me last night&mdash;what
did you do?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> I did nothing. I wished to be alone.
Solitude and silence produce great art, I believe.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Not when one is our age!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> Alice, I don&rsquo;t understand you to-day.
<a id="page-22" class="pagenum" title="22"></a>
For some time I&rsquo;ve been thinking that you were
changing; losing the fine sense of appreciation
which you have always had for so many things in
life and in art. Now, I am sure of it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Don&rsquo;t you understand? Well, as I
said&mdash;solitude is for the aged.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> Solitude and silence, two wonderful
words. What they call up in my mind! Solitude
for the physical and silence for the mind. It is in
these states that Art flourishes in its greatest form.
Art is turning back to the works of the primitive
artists, early Italians principally. And it is here
that it should turn&mdash;it should turn back to Art and
not to Nature, which only holds it back. And we
who expect to figure in this new Renaissance must
live as our masters, cloistered, alone, removed from
the material, within ourselves&mdash;as Angelico or as
Fra Filippo Lippi. For from the cave of Silence
comes the flame of creation, and we who hope to
receive a spark of this flame must worship in solitude,
as monks and as nuns.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice</span> (<span class="sd">smiling</span>). But have I not heard something
about a rope ladder in connection with Fra
Filippo Lippi?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> Legends&mdash;inventions of the common
<a id="page-23" class="pagenum" title="23"></a>
mind which sometimes are chronicled by still commoner
ones&mdash;and thus accepted finally as facts.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Truths, I should say.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George</span> (<span class="sd">jumping up</span>). I am going out!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele</span> (<span class="sd">in a boisterous voice</span>). Schopenhauer,
I prefer De Mau&mdash;(<span class="sd">Her voice is lost as
Alice&rsquo;s is heard speaking to George.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Don&rsquo;t run away, George, I want to
talk with you. I think that you are beginning to
understand the change in me, the new Alice, let us
say&mdash;and I want to make sure of it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George</span> (<span class="sd">sitting down</span>). No, I do not understand
the new Alice.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> You will not, would not be nearer the
truth, I think.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> No, I do not is exactly what I mean.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> I will try again to show you then,
George. (<span class="sd">She moves closer to him. George starts
to move away from her but changes his mind evidently
and sits still.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> I&rsquo;m ready for the revelation, Alice.
Make it as long as you like. It will probably be
our last real talk together.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Why?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> Because&mdash;because we have nothing
<a id="page-24" class="pagenum" title="24"></a>
in common&mdash;this new Alice pose&mdash;I can&rsquo;t think of
it as anything else but as a pose&mdash;has or will come
between us and break up our friendship.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> And in breaking up our friendship it
will produce something much finer.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> Finer? that is the finest thing in life&mdash;friendship.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> It is the beginning only of the finest
thing in life.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> Alice, you don&rsquo;t mean to say&mdash;Alice!&mdash;Lord!&mdash;you&rsquo;re
not making&mdash;(<span class="sd">She blushes and
turns away her eyes.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud</span> (<span class="sd">from the tea table</span>). They give &ldquo;Parsifal&rdquo;
next week. (<span class="sd">George tries to become composed.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice</span> (<span class="sd">speaking across the stage to the group</span>).
I know one of the &ldquo;Flower Maidens.&rdquo; I get
&ldquo;comps.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
(<span class="sd">Alice glances at George, who has failed to
become composed.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice</span> (<span class="sd">after a pause</span>). George?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George</span> (<span class="sd">weakly</span>). Well?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Do you like my pose as you call it?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George</span> (<span class="sd">looking at her</span>). Is it a pose?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice</span> (<span class="sd">after they look intently at each other,
<a id="page-25" class="pagenum" title="25"></a>
drops her glance</span>). Yes. (<span class="sd">Meaning no!&mdash;and adds
more excitedly.</span>) Yes, yes!&mdash;I was only acting to
see what you would do. (<span class="sd">But she takes his hand.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George</span> (<span class="sd">noticing it but showing no objection</span>).
Alice, what is happening to us? Here we sit hand-in-hand!
It&rsquo;s like bad vaudeville!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice</span> (<span class="sd">smiles</span>). I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;what do you
think?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> Don&rsquo;t ask me. I don&rsquo;t understand. I
can&rsquo;t think. I don&rsquo;t know. Perhaps we are about
to have a new George!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice</span> (<span class="sd">in a suppressed tone</span>). You understand!&mdash;a
new George&mdash;you shall come to-night!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> Yes!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice</span> (<span class="sd">looking away but tightening her hold
on George&rsquo;s hand</span>). Mine.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> What did you say?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Oh nothing, nothing.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> Alice&mdash;to-night. Now, let us go over
to the tea table. Maud is watching us.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Do you want to go?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George</span> (<span class="sd">rising from the couch</span>). No.
</p>

<p>
(<span class="sd">Alice rises also, and they both move towards
the table, George following. He carries their cups.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-26" class="pagenum" title="26"></a>
<span class="speaker">Maud.</span> Well, have you been talking magazine&mdash;&ldquo;Azure
Adder&rdquo;?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George</span> and <span class="speaker">Alice</span>. Yes.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> We were arranging details. We will
have all the titles of stories and poems printed in
red. Don&rsquo;t you think that that will be good?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud.</span> Not red, blue I should say.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> Well, in some color, red or blue.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Maud.</span> Blue is the better.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Yvonne</span> (<span class="sd">rising</span>). I must be going&mdash;is anyone
coming my way?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> We all must be going, I suppose. I
must go to the station and meet Uncle Billy.
</p>

<p>
(<span class="sd">Yvonne crosses the stage; the door at the back
is opened suddenly and Jack, husband of Camele, is
seen.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele</span> (<span class="sd">starts up from the tea table and looks
frightened, saying in a whisper to George</span>). Hide
my suit case.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Jack</span> (<span class="sd">in the door-way</span>). Oh, I beg your pardon&mdash;is
Vivian in?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Hello, Jack&mdash;come in. Vivian is out.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Jack.</span> I wanted to see him. He wishes to rent
the studio for several months, I hear.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-27" class="pagenum" title="27"></a>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> You can wait for him, we are just
about to leave.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Jack</span> (<span class="sd">coming down stage, sees Camele at the
tea table</span>). Hello, Cam, what are you doing here?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Yvonne</span> (<span class="sd">from the window</span>). What a sun-set!
Come and see. (<span class="sd">They all, except Camele and Jack,
go to the window.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele.</span> Maud asked me to lend her my kimona.
She wants to do some Japanese dances&mdash;I
brought it to her.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Jack.</span> I didn&rsquo;t know that you were friendly
since we were married, Cam. I was surprised when
I saw you.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele.</span> Don&rsquo;t call me Cam, Jack. Try to
call me Camele, here. And make the &ldquo;a&rdquo; long.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Jack.</span> Does it shock them? They make me&mdash;(<span class="sd">seeing
her canvases and paint box</span>). What are
you doing with your canvases and paint box?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele.</span> I was painting in the park. The canvases&mdash;the
canvases&mdash;oh, I was taking them to be
framed.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Jack.</span> All those?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele.</span> Yes, it will be cheaper having them
all framed at one time&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Jack.</span> I hope so. We are so hard up at present.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-28" class="pagenum" title="28"></a>
<span class="speaker">Camele.</span> Are we? Well, they can wait&mdash;the
canvases, I mean.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Jack.</span> I must have some clothes.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele.</span> Again?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Jack.</span> Again? Look at these.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele</span> (<span class="sd">coming close to him</span>). You look all
right, I think. (<span class="sd">She puts her hands on his shoulders.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Jack.</span> Are you ready to go? I&rsquo;ll not wait for
Vivian.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele.</span> Kiss me, Jack.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Jack.</span> What for&mdash;what&rsquo;s the matter with you?
You look tired and pale.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele.</span> Nothing&mdash;kiss me. (<span class="sd">They kiss.
Maud, looking back into the room, sees them. She
turns quickly, picks up her hat, puts it on and hurries
out.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele.</span> Let us go.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Jack.</span> All right.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele</span> (<span class="sd">putting on her hat</span>). I&rsquo;m going.
(<span class="sd">The others come from the window.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> Yes?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele.</span> Yes!
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-29" class="pagenum" title="29"></a>
<span class="speaker">Jack.</span> Here&rsquo;s your kimona.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele.</span> That is for Maud.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Where is she?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele.</span> She went out&mdash;she&rsquo;ll be back, I guess.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Camele</span> and <span class="speaker">Jack</span> (<span class="sd">moving towards the door</span>).
Good-bye!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">All.</span> Good-bye!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Yvonne</span> (<span class="sd">following them</span>). Good-bye.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice</span> and <span class="speaker">George</span>. Good-bye.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George</span> (<span class="sd">after a nervous silence</span>). I&rsquo;ll see you
to-night, Alice; now I must go to meet Uncle Billy.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Alice.</span> Then you can&rsquo;t see me to-night if he is
in town. You will have to arrange about the
&ldquo;Azure Adder.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">George.</span> The &ldquo;Azure Adder&rdquo;&mdash;my life&rsquo;s work&mdash;my
magazine. How I do wish to get it started!
Think what it means! A perfect magazine given to
the world after years of darkness. A book perfect
in printing, arrangement and in illustration&mdash;as
beautiful to look at as a masterpiece of painting or
sculpture. What a standard it will create when it
is published! It will stand alone&mdash;nothing but what
will suffer when compared to it. It will be above
other publications; above them as a golden star over
<a id="page-30" class="pagenum" title="30"></a>
a world of night and ignorance&mdash;all will be beneath
it! And I who have conceived it will be lost in its
splendor. Like a bumble-bee is lost in a lily of silver.
Laboring, laboring on for it to the end,
through old age, perhaps from beyond the grave.
What a life&mdash;yes, &ldquo;Azure Adder,&rdquo; I give to you my
time, my energy and my talents. (<span class="sd">He grows more
and more excited and is now speaking to himself.</span>)
I will make of you an aesthetic standard, an artistic
gauge and a religion! A new religion whose one and
only Goddess will be Beauty&mdash;Beauty veiled, alone
and sterile! And we who work for you will be its
first priests&mdash;the priests of a new religion! You
know what that means? It always has meant, and
will mean in this case, I hope, martyrdom and perhaps
death! Death for our gracious goddess&mdash;to
whom I give my mind and my body! Yes, great and
awful goddess, they are yours! (<span class="sd">He stands, with
his arms outstretched, against the door at the back.</span>)
Do as you will! (<span class="sd">In a loud ringing voice.</span>) They
are yours forever!!
